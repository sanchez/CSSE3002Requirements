# Actor Descriptions
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}p{11cm}}
\hline\textbf{Actor Name} & \textbf{Description} \\\hline
Visa Processor & Less common user but more frequent and with higher permissions. These users will be reviewing data entered by the Visa Applicant users and approve/deny visas.\\
External Verifier & Users who are not responsible for processing applications, nor under the responsibility of a Manager, but have can have significant information influencing a Visa Processorâ€™s decision. A Visa Processor can refer an application to an External Verifier to receive a recommendation. Examples of External Verifiers are members of the AFP or FBI, medical doctors responsible for examinations, or an employer verifying that the applicant is an employee.\\
Manager & Manages a group of Visa Processors by creating Visa Processor accounts with necessary restrictions and monitors processor actions and performance.\\
Policy Manager & Rare users, responsible for updating system configuration to reflect changes in visa policy. E.g. introducing a new type of visa, changing the list of countries that automatically require extra attention.\\
Visa Applicant & The person who apply visa through the system \\\hline
